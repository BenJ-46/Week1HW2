*Below you will find details of each page*
> IndexHTML
For the index HTML, I began with the standard reset and bootstrap css links, followed by adding grid container for mobile rrsponsivness. After added in the **NavBar** with adequate names tags and linking the other 3 pages. After simply added in small **picturecard** to add in a picture and short profile about myself
> ContactHTML
For the Contact html same steps were followed along with a input box wich im guessing we will learn how to properly get to function.
> PortfolioHTML
For the portfolio html I added in a simple linked card with a functioning button to link my clicker game. I then rounded the edges of the card using my **portfoliostyle.css** and changed the color to a matching tan that my index html contained in order to give it a better and smoother look.
